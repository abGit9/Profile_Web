<h1>Profile Website</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
To add a personal touch to my resume, I crafted a comprehensive profile website  showcasing my background and experiences using colorful animations mainly implemented with the anime.js library. 

The code in this repository specifically pertains to the web development section of the website, summarizing my skills in this area. For an in-depth view and to see my animations in action, you can explore the corresponding page on my profile website via this link: https://abhat.io/app/software/web/web.html.
